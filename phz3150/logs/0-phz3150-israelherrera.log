Correct Syntax, Incorrect Characters:

"Thes3 instrucktions h4ve way to0 m4ny w0rds, and nothing makes any sense lmao."
Incorrect Syntax, Correct Characters:

"Natural because doesn't work langauge capitol letters each, all comma insignificant differences.""
Explanation:

Natural languages are inefficient for programming because their flexibility and tolerance
for variations (like capitalization and punctuation) lead to ambiguity.
A single misplaced character can completely alter the meaning in a programming context, 
making it impossible for a compiler to understand and execute instructions correctly.
